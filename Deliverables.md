# Deliverables

## Checkpoint (6-12 March)

Each group must submit in Moodle a PDF format **brief presentation** (max 5 slides), which will be used in the class to analyze, together with the teacher, the progress of the work. 

The presentation should contain:

- [X] 1. Specification of the work to be performed (definition of the optimization problem to be solved)
- [X] 2. Related work with references to works found in a bibliographic search (articles, web pages, and/or source code), 
- [X] 3. Formulation of the problem as a search problem (state representation, initial state, objective test, operators (names, preconditions, effects, and costs), heuristics/evaluation function) or optimization problem (solution representation, neighborhood/mutation and crossover functions, hard constraints, evaluation functions)
- [X] 4. Implementation work already carried out (programming language, development environment, data structures, among others).


## Final (25 March)

Each group must submit in Moodle two files: 
- [ ] A PDF format **presentation** (max 10 slides) with aforementioned for the checkpoint and 
    - [ ] 5. Details on the approach (heuristics, evaluation functions, operators, ...)
    - [ ] 6. Implemented algorithms (search algorithms, minimax, metaheuristics)
    - [ ] 7. Experimental results, using appropriate tables/plots and comparing the various methods, heuristics, algorithms and respective parameterizations for different scenarios/problems.
    - [ ] 8. Conclusions slide
    - [X] 9. A slide referencing consulted and used materials (software, websites, scientific articles, ...).
- [ ] 10. The implemented **code**
    - Properly commented
    - Including a “readme” file with instructions on how to compile, run, and use the program. 

Based on the submitted presentation, the students must carry out a demonstration (about 10 minutes) of the work, in the practical class, or in another period to be designated by the teachers of the course.
